# Weekly SMART Learning Plan for Improving .NET Development and Soft Skills

## Specific

The goal is to enhance my .NET development expertise by completing Dometrain courses on Clean Architecture, Microservices, Monoliths, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and load balancing. I will also deepen my understanding of hosting .NET applications using Azure and GitHub Actions, and explore modern computing concepts like service workers, serverless functions, and edge computing. To reinforce learning, I will create small proof-of-concept (PoC) applications to test each area of knowledge, focusing on deploying these applications. Additionally, I will improve my soft skills by completing the Master Channel course "Becoming Better Consultants" to enhance my consulting and communication abilities.

## Measurable

Progress will be tracked weekly by:

- Completing specific modules or lessons in the Dometrain courses, targeting 1-2 modules per week per course.
- Developing and deploying at least 2 PoC applications, with a weekly expansion of features, based on the newly learned skills.
- Completing the course "Becoming Better Consultants" course.
- Documenting weekly progress in a log, including completed tasks, PoC status. (in the training traject excel file)

## Achievable

The plan is realistic given my current workload and resources:

- I will dedicate my days to studying Dometrain courses and at least 2 hours to developing proof-of-concept (PoC) applications.
- I have access to Azure credits and GitHub Actions for hosting PoCs.
- My existing .NET knowledge supports learning advanced topics, and Dometrain courses are structured for intermediate learners.
- I will use online communities (e.g., Dometrain forums, Azure documentation) and colleagues for support.

## Relevant

This learning plan aligns with my career goals of becoming a proficient .NET developer and a well-rounded consultant:

- Mastering Clean Architecture, Microservices, Monoliths, and DDD will enable me to build scalable, maintainable .NET applications, increasing my market value.
- Understanding Azure, GitHub Actions, service workers, serverless functions will position me to develop and deploy modern applications.
- Enhancing soft skills through the "Becoming Better Consultants" course will improve my collaboration with clients and teams, making me a more effective professional.

## Time-Bound

The plan is structured on a weekly basis, with new tasks assigned each week to ensure steady progress:

- **Weekly Tasks (Example Structure)**:
  - Complete 1-2 modules of the current Dometrain course (e.g., Clean Architecture, Microservices, Monoliths, or DDD, ...etc).
  - Work on a PoC application related to the current course topic (e.g., outline, develop, test, or deploy).
  - Complete 1-2 lessons in the "Becoming Better Consultants" course.
  - Apply or practice one soft skill in a professional setting (e.g., effective communication during a meeting).
  - Study or experiment with Azure, GitHub Actions, service workers, serverless functions when relevant to the PoC.
  - Document progress, including completed modules, PoC status, and soft skills feedback. (in the training traject excel file)
- Tasks will be adjusted weekly based on the current course and PoC development stage, ensuring all topics (Clean Architecture, Microservices, Monoliths, DDD, hosting, and computing concepts) are covered progressively, with soft skills integrated throughout.

This weekly plan ensures I complete all courses, deploy PoC applications, and apply enhanced soft skills, positioning me as a stronger .NET developer and consultant.
